## Overview

Iâ€™m excited to share the successful completion of my latest Power BI project, **"Comprehensive Business Insights,"** designed to empower AtliQ Hardware with data-driven decision-making capabilities across finance, sales, marketing, and supply chain management.

## Company Overview

**AtliQ Hardware** specializes in products such as mice, keyboards, PCs, laptops, and desktops, sold through both brick-and-mortar and e-commerce channels. The company has experienced rapid global expansion through:
- Retail Stores

## The Challenge

AtliQ Hardware faced significant losses from a poorly analyzed store opening in America. To stay competitive, it became clear that AtliQ needed to build an analytics team to enhance decision-making processes.

## The Solution

Using Power BI, I analyzed over 1.5 million records to provide actionable business insights and help AtliQ make informed decisions.
